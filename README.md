# COS470-final-project

This is an implementation of a model-based agent for playing
Generation 1 Pokemon Battles. It was written as the final
project for COS 470: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.

For the full project report, see `writeup/writeup.pdf`.

## Running the Project

## Development

The project is using Nix and `direnv` to manage local dependencies.

Testing is implemented using the `unittest` framework.
I am using `nose` for a test runner to make imports easier.
